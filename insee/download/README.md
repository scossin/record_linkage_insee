# INSEE death files

The files can be downloaded at this address: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/


## Downloads

As the hospital information system of Bordeaux University Hospital was set up in 2005-2006, we have chosen to download these death files ** only from 2005 **.

The text files have been downloaded and are in the directory.
Files were initially downloaded from this site: http://data.cquest.org/insee_deces/download/data
using the download.R script. Since this website is not update-to-date, files are manually downloaded from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/
now. 

## Updates
Currently, INSEE data is provided every month.
