# INSEE death files

The txt files can be downloaded at this address: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/  
Put the txt files in the **data** folder in the current directory. 

## Downloads

Files were initially downloaded from this site: http://data.cquest.org/insee_deces/download/data
using the download.R script. Since this website is not update-to-date, files are now manually downloaded from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/
now. 

## Updates
Currently, INSEE data is provided every month.
